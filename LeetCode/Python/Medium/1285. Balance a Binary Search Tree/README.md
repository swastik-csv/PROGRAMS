### 📜 Problem Description

Given the  `root`  of a binary search tree, return  *a  **balanced**  binary search tree with the same node values* . If there is more than one answer, return  **any of them** .

A binary search tree is  **balanced**  if the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than  `1` .

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,null]
Output: [2,1,3,null,null,null,4]
Explanation: This is not the only correct answer, [3,1,4,null,2] is also correct.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,1,3]

```

**Constraints:**

	
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range  `[1, 104]` .
	
- `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
